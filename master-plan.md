# File .master-plan.yaml

The `.master-plan.yaml` file would contain all the desired/known test cases for OEP platform.  From this file detailed testcases would be derived. Testcases will be kept in the repo and would have a unique id `tcid` prefixed.  The excerpt of the file shown below, format has been kept similar to K8S CR.

## Schema format

##### `tcid` -- referers to a unique id for the testcase. 

Each test case would be called as job in gitlab pipeline using  gitlab-ci.yaml. Actual test case would be having this unique id prefixed . Each test case would have a seperate readme. The tcid will be in lower case.

`tcid` is constructed following, each tcid would be unique and will have 6-7 chars

first two letter indicates the feature.

third and fourth letter indicates the sub feature.

last two chars would be digits in incrementatal way.

Example 

| Feature                   | SubFeature                  |

| iu -- Install and Upgrade | oi -- OpenEBS Install       |
